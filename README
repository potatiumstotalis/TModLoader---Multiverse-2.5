How to set up:
If you have any Terraria world running, close it, and head to your mod configs, to set up the Subworld configuration:

- 1st, Set up your Subworlds, and go back to the main menu to reload.
- 2nd, set up your Teleport Filters, and go back to main menu to reload once more.


How to use:
Now, you can craft a Portal, or use the commands `/mvtp modname/subworldname` to travel to your subworld of choice.
- When you place the Portal, a UI appears and lets you pick one of your subworlds
- When you right-click the Portal, you will be transported to that subworld (the subworld will be generated on the 1st time you do this)


Original Description:

Multiverse 2 allows Server Owners and Solo Players to add "Subworlds" to their World, Similar to the Multiverse Plugin for Minecraft.

For players and server admins:
To add a subworld, just go into your config on either the server or your client depending if you are in singleplayer or not
and add a new entry in the `Worlds` list. change the name and choose the generator you want for your subworld.
To enter a subworld, type `/mvtp subworldname` in the chat
if the world was added by another mod and was not generated by Multiverse 2, then type `/mvtp modname/subworldname`

For developers wanting to add their own generators:
Just subclass ModGenerator and override `List<GenPass> GenPasses(int seed, WorldGenConfiguration configuration);` to add the gen passes.
