This is an update to Multiverse 2 (made by Witherking25), working on the latest (1.4.4.9) Terraria / TModLoader Versions.
It was not thoroughly tested, so it may still have some minor bugs.


Original Description:

Multiverse 2 allows Server Owners and Solo Players to add "Subworlds" to their World, Similar to the Multiverse Plugin for Minecraft.

For players and server admins:
To add a subworld, just go into your config on either the server or your client depending if you are in singleplayer or not
and add a new entry in the `Worlds` list. change the name and choose the generator you want for your subworld.
To enter a subworld, type `/mvtp subworldname` in the chat
if the world was added by another mod and was not generated by Multiverse 2, then type `/mvtp modname/subworldname`

For developers wanting to add their own generators:
Just subclass ModGenerator and override `List<GenPass> GenPasses(int seed, WorldGenConfiguration configuration);` to add the gen passes.
